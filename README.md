eJamar Technology, exergames controller
\subsection{The eJamar GC}

The innovative exergame controller, named eJamar, is introduced. Its development adheres to key design principles, including usability, physical characteristics, and user experience, with a strong focus on ergonomics and comfort. Consequently, a commercial casing intended for hand exercises was utilized, featuring a grip handle with grooves that fit the natural shape of the hand. Moreover, it includes an adjustable knob to modify the grip distance, making it adaptable to different hand sizes and enhancing comfort.

The eJamar functions as a wireless controller specifically de
signed to send commands to interact
ive serious games. Importantly, it can measure hand grip strength, making it ideal for hand rehabilitation exercises. Additionally, it incorporates an inertial measurement unit (IMU) that detects the userâ€™s hand movements. Further enhancing the experience, it includes a haptic feedback system with internal vibration actuators. Finally, its user interface has a button and two LED status indicators to facilitate interaction.

At the moment two exergames have been developed using the free software UNITY. 
The first one, Peter Jumper (a, b, c, d), consists of a character, Peter, that have to jump obstacles in order to avoid collisions and coplete a time game. This exergame has 3 leves, and each one increses its diffciult. The game has 2 modes of play. In the first one, the player has to press the eJamar, when the force is higher than a minimum level, Peter jump. In the second mode the player has to move the hand making flexion or ulnar movements to skip.
The second game is Andromeda (e, f, g, h).This consists of a aero-ship that has to shoot bullets and destroy the enemies ships. The user has to press the eJamar to shoot the bullets and make pronosupination movements to move the ship from right to left.
